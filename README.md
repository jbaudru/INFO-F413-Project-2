# INFOF413-Project-2

## Motivations
The goal of this project is to analyze the behavior of an algorithm for solving the Max 3-SAT problem that always satisfies at least a fraction 7/8 of the clauses.

## User guide
This code is written in **Julia 1.7.0**, it has been realized in the framework of the Data Structures and Algorithms course of the Free University of Brussels.

## Results
Below, the different comparative graphs of the implemented algorithm :
