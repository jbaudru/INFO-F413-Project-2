# INFO-F413-Project-2

## Motivations
The goal of this project is to analyze the behavior of an algorithm for solving the **Max 3-SAT** problem that always satisfies at least a fraction 7/8 of the clauses.

## User guide
This code is written in **Julia 1.7.0**, it has been realized for the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course of the **Free University of Brussels**.

## Results
Below, the different comparative graphs of the implemented algorithm : <br>
